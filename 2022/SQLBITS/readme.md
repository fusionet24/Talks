##Talks

At SQL Bits 2022 I did two talks.


### COSMOS 101

Find out everything you need to know to get started with Azure Cosmos DB in 20 minutes or less.

What's partitioning?

What's consistency?

What does multi modal really mean?


### Is HTAP The Future?

Hybrid Transactional Analytical Processing is the mixture of OLTP and OLAP processing within a single system.

What challenges do they systems solve?

What value can they unlock and how could you leverage them?

Are there any mature HTAPs even out there?

This talk will cover the what and why of HTAPs and how they build sustainable real-time applications of the future.
