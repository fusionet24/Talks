These are the talks I do often. Below is a description:

##Making Power BI do things it probably shouldn't!

Power BI is an incredible tool but if your business case requires you to make something that is definitely not the intention of the Power BI team.

In this talk, we will explore:

- Using power bi to browse websites
and interact with them for data collection purposes (using selenium inside power bi)

- Creating games In Power Bi


## Optimize your life with Power Automate

Covid-19 gave us all unprecedented challenges and changes to our ways of working. Some of those challenges allowed us to reflect and reset our lives.

This is an exploration of how the power platform enabled myself to build a series of tools that made life easier during this difficult time.

Some of the topics covered:
- How to be left alone while working from home!
- How to Remember and Optimize everything you do!

Another way to describe this talk would be "Scott does silly things with the power platform that are actually helpful!"
